# AutoCRUD.js

AutoCRUD.js is a configuration-driven backend framework built using Node.js.  
It automatically generates CRUD APIs using a YAML configuration file.

---

## Project Overview

In backend development, writing CRUD APIs repeatedly is time-consuming and error-prone.  
AutoCRUD.js reduces this effort by generating APIs, models, controllers, and routes automatically.

---

## Problem Statement

Developers face issues like repetitive coding, slow development, poor maintainability, and lack of standard structure.

---

## Solution

Developers define database schemas in a YAML file.  
The framework reads this file and generates complete REST APIs with validation and error handling.
